Just a small playground to try out some ideas.

I want to build a small robot, virtually, having some joints, links, ... all defined quite similar to FE-models. 
Next step, I will try to rotate and move the points and links.
Get everything a little bit more in colorful pictures.
Show a "animation" about movement.

And at the end: Try to reach points at the edge of the arm and let the control find the way to get there.
